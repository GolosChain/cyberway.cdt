## ABI generator attributes
Unlike the old ABI generator tool, the new tool uses C++11 or GNU style attributes to mark ```actions``` and ```tables```.
#### [[eosio::action]]
This attribute marks either a struct or a method as an action.
Example (four ways to declare an action for ABI generation):
```c++
// this is the C++11 and greater style attribute
[[eosio::action]]
void testa( name n ) {
   // do something
}

// this is the GNU style attribute, this can be used in C code and prior to C++ 11
__attribute__((eosio_action))
void testa( name n ){
   // do something
}

struct [[eosio::action]] testa {
   name n;
   EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( testa, (n) )
};

struct __attribute__((eosio_action)) testa {
   name n;
   EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( testa, (n) )
};
```
If your action name is not a valid [EOSIO name](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/naming-conventions) you can explicitly specify the name in the attribute ```c++ [[eosio::action("<valid action name>")]]```

Example (two ways to declare a table for ABI generation):
```
struct [[eosio::table]] testtable {
   uint64_t owner;
   /* all other fields */
};

struct __attribute__((eosio_table)) testtable {
   uint64_t owner;
   /* all other fields */
};

typedef eosio::multi_index<"tablename"_n, testtable> testtable_t;
```
If you don't want to use the multi-index you can explicitly specify the name in the attribute ```c++ [[eosio::table("<valid action name>")]]```.

For an example contract of ABI generation please see the file ./examples/abigen_test/test.cpp. You can generate the ABI for this file with `eosio-abigen test.cpp --output=test.abi`.

### Fixing an ABI or Writing an ABI Manually
- The sections to the ABI are pretty simple to understand and the syntax is purely JSON, so it is reasonable to write an ABI file manually.
- The ABI generation will never be completely perfect for every contract written. Advanced features of the newest version of the ABI will require manual construction of the ABI, and odd and advanced C++ patterns could capsize the generators type deductions. So having a good knowledge of how to write an ABI should be an essential piece of knowledge of a smart contract writer.
- Please refer to [developers.eos.io "How to Write an ABI File"](https://developers.eos.io/eosio-cpp/docs/how-to-write-an-abi) to learn about the different sections of an ABI.
