# Removed Ricardian Contracts

In order to give all users equal rights in the system and to exclude possibility of users who have any privileges with respect to others, the program components supporting Ricardian contracts have been removed from CyberWay CDT, including:
  * Ricardian contracts has completely been removed from configuration and build.
  * Removed a text description of the smart contracts rules, which included provisions for resolving conflicts between users with involvement of a third party â€” a privileged account.  

> **Note:**  
> CyberWay system allows users to introduce any guarantee rules for resolving conflicts between two parties with the involvement of a third party as Arbitrage (for example, engaging a third party as a Guarantor Arbitrage before making a deal between two parties. Also, crediting the assets of one party to the Arbitration account before making a transaction and obtaining guarantees for their transfer to another party after all the conditions of the transaction have been fulfilled by the parties).
